Powered by Apache Calcite, the CBO optimizes and calculates the cost of various plans for a query. 
The main goal of a CBO is to generate efficient execution plans by examining the tables and conditions specified in the query, 
ultimately cutting down on query execution time and reducing resource utilization.

The CBO uses column and table statistics stored in the Hive metastore to create query plans that improve query performance.
 ... The CBO uses these statistics to estimate the cardinality and number of distinct values, etc. 
These estimates then help generate highly efficient query plans.
